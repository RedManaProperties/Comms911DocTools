    """
    If you wish to integrate or experiment with Generative AI models using the Gemini API, 
    you will need an API key. This key is used for authentication and usage tracking.
    
    Here are the steps to obtain one:

    1.  **Sign In:** Navigate to the **Google AI Studio** website (`aistudio.google.com`) and sign in with your Google account.
    2.  **Accept Terms:** On your first visit, review and accept the terms of service.
    3.  **Get Key:** Look for the "**Get API key**" button in the left navigation panel or the center of the page.
    4.  **Create Key:** Click "**Create API key**" and choose to create it in a new or existing Google Cloud project.
    5.  **Save:** Your API key will be generated and displayed. **Copy this key immediately** and store it securely, as it grants access to the API and is tied to your usage limits or billing.
